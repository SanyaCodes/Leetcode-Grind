## Merge Strings Alternately

# Question:

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. 
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
Return the merged string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

# Answer:

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        ans = ''
        mlen = max(len(word1), len(word2))
        counter = 0
        dc = dict()
        while counter < mlen:
            if counter < len(word1):
                if counter not in dc.keys():
                    dc[counter] = word1[counter]
                else:
                    dc[counter] += word1[counter]
            if counter < len(word2):
                if counter not in dc.keys():
                    dc[counter] = word2[counter]
                else:
                    dc[counter] += word2[counter]
            counter += 1
        for key,value in dc.items():
            ans += value
        return ans
