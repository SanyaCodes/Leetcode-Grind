The kth Factor of n

# Question:

You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.

# Answer:

class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        counter = 0
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                counter += 1
                if counter == k:
                    return i
        return -1
